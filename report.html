	<h1><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
	<p>As a first time html user, I’ve had major difficulties understanding the concept of the very html codes. However all it took was more practices in class and extra practices at home to teach myself the very basic of html. My level of knowledge is not advance but I am happy with what I have created so far. With guidance from our model tutors and also taking the effort to teach myself during the weekends, I have improved my understanding of the World Wide Web creation.  Alot of research from YouTube tutorial to online articles was done in the process of creating this webpage.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	This term went by quickly so as our lessons and most lessons were directly into intermediate. Hence I did self studies and alot of practices at home in order to understand the lessons. In my experience it was difficult at first but once I got familiar with HTML, I understood the structure was easy and most of the commands, tags etc were to be remembered by experience. The only way to remember would be constantly using them in various ways. The term covered us basic usage of general codes of flexbox and animation etc, therefore anything further detailed we had to put an effort to learn ourselves by experimenting and creating alot of test webpages.
    Honestly I still would be having trouble with flex box and trying to remember certain properties and attributes. Web development seems to be alot more fun if you know what you are doing and know your codes well enough. Although i lack both on certain level, i did enjoy creating it and realising how much fun it was to create simple tasks.

	<h1><a name="gui">GUI Design Decision</a></h1>
	<p>My idea was to keep it simple, not too flashy and not too much content so as long as the basic mechanics was used to show my understanding of html codes.  A top section bar was chosen as I felt it was easier to work with. As always it follows the basic format the header, body and footer in all pages.  Colours were chosen a pleasant elegant tone to be easy with the eyes and navigation was done user friendly. Hover text was which as a fun useful tool I picked up in my online research.  I had some troubles applying the flexbox mechanics, mostly getting lost with parent and child relation codes however in the end I manage to pull off most of it and it worked for me. In the “Contact Me” page, I’ve placed a small form for the users to fill in. Although I have not experience in learning PHP yet, I’ve intentionally placed an error on a new winder whenever user clicks “Submit” button. Basically just showing what contents will be and their mechanics I’ve understood.</p>

	<h1><a name="experience">My Experiences</a></h1>
	<p>To be honest it was actually hard to apply and make some of the complicating codes. I already knew the basic structure on how to make a simple template. Which was a huge stepping stone for me as I could work my way around it (design wise). My great challenge was actually making the flexbox work the way I want. At times the code I apply which I think would work would not and sometimes it would not appear the way I want it to me. As always I had to resort to countless articles for troubleshoot and solutions. The best way I realise for me to learn was through trial and error; playing around with certain attributes and properties to see what it does and it doesn’t.  This way I understood most on what and when the code should be applied.  I still have confusion in flexbox when it comes to creating massive columns and rows and mixing text with images inside. On the good side, it was a great challenge for me and I actually enjoyed trying to fix it.</p>

	<h1><a name="conclusion"> Conclusion </a></h1>
	<p>As still a learner I am, this basic html structure was indeed a learning challenge for me. It may not look professional but I hope that it conveys how much I have understood in creating a webpage. Although I must admit there are few draw backs I am still in process of understanding such as flexbox and manipulating the attributes, properties and also remembering few properties. However if I had more time in this I would have definitely take an extra mile on learning animation for html and adding javascript codes to enhance the pages further. Perhaps the limitation of this project was maybe using the javascript and understanding PHP. I lack the knowledge of this in my as a first term student but regardless of that I have convey enough my understanding of html.</p>
